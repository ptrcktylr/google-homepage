# Google Homepage

My attempt at recreating the Google homepage. Assignment from The Odin Project's curriculum.

## Self-Reflection

It was difficult to align all the elements on the page and make them scalable when a user changes the window size, but I'm happy with how it turned out. Doing this involved a lot of messing around with width, height, padding, margin, flex, etc. Also involved using the Chrome developer tools constantly to see how Google made their page.
